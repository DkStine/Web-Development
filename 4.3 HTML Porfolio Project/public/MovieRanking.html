<h1>The Best Movies and Web Series according to Deepak</h1>

<h2>My top 3 recommendations of all time:</h2>

<h3>Scam 1992</h3>

<p>
  One of the best series on stock market which I have ever watched. A person who
  doesn't have any knowledge of stocks can also watch it with utmost
  entertainment.
